### **General Info**

This project aims to deliver a detailed report that identifies key performance indicators, discovers trends and provides data-based recommendations that support the strategic decision making of HR professionals, optimize the allocation of resources in accordance with the organization's standards, and foster a high-performance work culture in employees.

### **Technologies**
The data sets were provided by Simplilearn in the [Post Graduate Program in Business Analysis](https://www.simplilearn.com/pgp-business-analysis-certification-training-course) that I completed and which you can download for review here üëâ [emp_record_table.csv](https://github.com/KaroLili1/myBAPortfolio.com/blob/main/MySQL/emp_record_table.csv), [proj_table.csv](https://github.com/KaroLili1/myBAPortfolio.com/blob/main/MySQL/proj_table.csv) and [data_science_team.csv](https://github.com/KaroLili1/myBAPortfolio.com/blob/main/MySQL/data_science_team.csv).

For Exploratory Data Analysis I used several aggregate functions, such as COUNT(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX(),ROUND() and CONCAT(); operators such as BETWEEN, AND, LIKE, UNION.  Also I applied IF-THEN-ELSEIF statements to execute some logical conditions; Joins to combine data from different tables, and other codes like Stored Procedures, Stored Functions, Views, Indexes, Query Execution Plan to improve database performance.

For example, to calculate the 5% salary bonus for all employees, depending on their performance ratings and salaries, use the following formula in my query:

*MySQL*
```SQL
SELECT Emp_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ROLE, DEPT, ROUND((SALARY * 0.05) * EMP_RATING) AS EMP_BONUS
FROM emp_record_table
ORDER BY EMP_BONUS DESC;
```

*Output:*
