### General Info

The aim of this project was to build a prototype of a digital solution to automate the manual book management system and other related activities of the Stanford University library.<br />
<br />
The digital system I designed offers several advantages, including efficient books management, reduction of overheads, increase in productivity, maintenance of updated records, and generation of key dynamic reports for better decision making by the Library Management.

‚û°Ô∏è[Here](https://github.com/KaroLili1/myBAPortfolio.com/blob/main/BA_Projects/LIBRARY%20MANAGEMENT%20SYSTEM%20FOR%20STANFORD_Karol.pdf) you can access to and download the final document of the project of my autorship, reviewed and approved by the instructor of the module on
Preparation for the Certified Business Analyst Professional<sup>TM</sup> (CBAP¬Æ) from [Simplilearn](https://www.simplilearn.com/pgp-business-analysis-certification-training-course).

In the first pages of the document you will see the initial problem and the solution I proposed, analyzed according to the parameters of the Business Analysis Core Concept Model<sup>TM</sup> (BACCM<sup>TM</sup>) established by the Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (IIBA¬Æ BABOK¬Æ).  In the following pages, other aspects such as the main features, scope, functional and non-functional requirements of the system are described.  Finally, flow charts, process map, UML and ER diagramas are presented, as well as sample mockups for the system user view

### Technologies

The tools I used in this project were:
- Microsoft PowerPoint 365  ![powerpoint1](https://github.com/KaroLili1/myBAPortfolio.com/assets/155495785/1b4ec471-f605-4ef2-ac4b-4487d0846905)
 for designing process flow diagrams, process map, use case diagram UML and dataflow diagram;
- [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/?). An intelligent diagramming application to create the ER (Entity-Relationship Model) diagram of the system; and
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).  I used this web-based tool to create the system mockup sample with visualization for PC and mobile phone.
