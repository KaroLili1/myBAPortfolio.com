### General Info

In this project I designed a digital solution to automate the manual book management system and other related activities of the Stanford University library.<br />
<br />
The digital system offers several advantages, including efficient books management, reduction of overheads, increase in productivity, maintenance of updated records, and generation of dynamic reports for better decision making.

### Technologies

The tools I used for this project were Microsoft PowerPoint for designing process flow diagrams, process map, use case diagram UML and dataflow diagram.  To create the ER (Entity-Relationship Model) diagram of the system I used Lucidchart tool and  finally, Balsamiq to create the system mockup sample with visualization for PC and mobile phone.
