### General Info

The aim of this project was to build a prototype of a digital solution to automate the manual book management system and other related activities of the Stanford University library.<br />
<br />
The digital system I designed offers several advantages, including efficient books management, reduction of overheads, increase in productivity, maintenance of updated records, and generation of key dynamic reports for better decision making by the Library Management.

### Technologies

The tools I used in this project were:
- Microsoft PowerPoint 365  ![powerpoint1](https://github.com/KaroLili1/myBAPortfolio.com/assets/155495785/1b4ec471-f605-4ef2-ac4b-4487d0846905)
 for designing process flow diagrams, process map, use case diagram UML and dataflow diagram;
- [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/?). An intelligent diagramming application to create the ER (Entity-Relationship Model) diagram of the system; and
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).  I used this web-based tool to create the system mockup sample with visualization for PC and mobile phone.
