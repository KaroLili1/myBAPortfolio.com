### General Info

In this project I designed a digital solution to automate the manual book management system and other related activities of the Stanford University library.<br />
<br />
The digital system offers several advantages, including efficient books management, reduction of overheads, increase in productivity, maintenance of updated records, and generation of dynamic reports for better decision making.
