### General Info
The aim of this project was to design a sales dashboard that analyses the sales based on various product categories, adding an interactive feature that allows users to select a product category and see the trend month-wise and product-wise accordingly.


### Technologies
I have used MySQL
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE cond = 2
```

### Status
The project has been reviewed and approved.
